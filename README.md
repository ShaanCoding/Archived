## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/jsQuiz.gif)

This project was a lightweight javascript-based quiz taker, done in order to pick up and further strengthen my skills in JavaScript. As a result whilst it isn't the prettiest or most functional it was done in order to increase my proficiency in the language.

## Built With
