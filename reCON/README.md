# reCON
This application is program intended for developers to bulk edit colors for icons and other assets. During the development phase, especially when creating buttons and other UI/UX elements developers often need to reskin single color assets. This program takes out the repetitive task of editing each image by making an automated tool that automatically edits every image automatically. Just place the image in a folder, specify a color and press start.
